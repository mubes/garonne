 * Audio module
 * ============
 *
 * This module controls the audio output. The code automatically deals with different
 * sample rates etc....but it's only mono.
 *
 * In a 'full' implementation this probably needs extending to read directly from a file rather
 * than from memory....that'll run out quickly.
